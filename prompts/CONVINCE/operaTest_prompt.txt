"On my left we can see the painting by Felice Casorati entitled Daphne at Pavarolo. The artist paints his wife Daphne, the canvas is from 1934. This large composition presents
an articulated perspective game: the background of the landscape, beyond the shoulders of Daphne, sitting on the windowsill, is reflected on the mirrored glass of the window
shutters thus giving a sense of panoramic vision.
 Daphne, shown here in a very relaxed and contemplative pose, was pregnant. Their son, Francesco Casorati, was born in 1934 and he too became an artist of international fame.
 Felice Casorati was born in Novara in 1883. In 1907 he exhibits the painting entitled Portrait of a Lady at the Venice Biennale. He is inspired by the paintings of Cezanne
 and Piero della Francesca. He opens his studio in Turin and becomes the protagonist and promoter of the cultural and artistic life of the city. He meets Riccardo Gualino who
 commissions him his own portrait and that of his family and entrusts him with the project for the private theater of his home. Casorati will be present at all major exhibitions
 in Italy and abroad and there will be many awards on the occasion of the many monographic exhibitions.
 In Turin the Thirties brought great changes in the artistic panorama. Casorati founded the school in via Mazzini in which he promotes young emerging artists including some
 abstract painters such as Osvaldo Licini, who we will find in the next stage."
